Ecologists found that species' environmental DNA (eDNA) can offer insights into the genetics of whole populations, which can help track and prevent the spread of invasive species. This advancement can also help conserve endangered species, offering insights similar to forensic investigations. Ecologists have shown that the genetic material that species shed into their environments can reveal not only the presence of the species but also a broad range of information about the genetics of whole populations. This information can assist researchers in pinpointing the origin of a newly invasive population and in halting further invasions.
