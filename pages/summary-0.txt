Many investors have shifted their asset allocations to account for Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) issues. This article provides a practitioner's viewpoint about ESG investing. The authors use portfolio construction techniques to explore the complexities of ESG investing and identify trade-offs that arise when constructing ESG portfolios. They consider both market-cap-weighted and optimized portfolios representing different ESG themes. Each extension to a given analysis improves the ability to identify potential anomalies that might arise from ESG investing. The authors show that the return and risk profiles of strategies that exclude unwanted securities from a benchmark depend materially on how admissible securities are weighted.
