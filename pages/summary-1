The Wollemi pine is a tree that was believed to have gone extinct 2 million years ago. However, it was rediscovered in 1994 by a group of hikers in a canyon in Wollemi National Park, Australia. Scientists have now decoded its genome to understand how it has survived for so long. The pine has 26 chromosomes and contains 12.2 billion base pairs. It is extremely low in genetic diversity, suggesting a bottleneck some 10,000 to 26,000 years ago. The plants do not exchange much genetic material and reproduce mostly by cloning themselves through coppicing. The decoding of the genome has revealed why the Wollemi pine is susceptible to disease, and has implications for the species' survival.
