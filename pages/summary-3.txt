The world is getting warmer, and one way to help stop that is to capture the carbon that is warming the earth. There are special machines that can take the carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the air before it gets into the atmosphere. The carbon can be stored underground or used to make things like jet fuel. The only challenge is that it takes a lot of energy to run the machines, and that is slowing down their use.
