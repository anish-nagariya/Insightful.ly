The Wollemi pine is a tree that was believed to have gone extinct 2 million years ago, until it was rediscovered in 1994. Now, scientists have decoded its genome to understand how it has survived for so long. The pine has 26 chromosomes and contains 12.2 billion base pairs. It is extremely low in genetic diversity, suggesting a bottleneck some 10,000 to 26,000 years ago. The trees appear to reproduce mostly by cloning themselves through coppicing. Their rarity may be partly due to the high number of transposons, or jumping genes, which can change their position within the genome.
