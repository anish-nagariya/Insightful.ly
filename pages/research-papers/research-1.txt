SUSTAINABLE INVESTING FROM A PRACTITIONER’S\nVIEWPOINT: WHAT’S IN YOUR ESG PORTFOLIO?\nJeffrey R. Bohna, Lisa R. Goldbergb and Simge Ulucamc\n\nMany investors have shifted their asset allocations to account for Environmental, Social,\nand Governance (ESG) issues. While we welcome thisshift from an ethical perspective, the\nfinancial and non-financial benefits of ESG investing as well as best practicesfor portfolio\nconstruction are subjects of heated debate. We look at aspects of the debate through a series\nof practical examples. First, we illustrate the trade-off between risk control and unwanted\n\nexposures in energy and “vice\n stock exclusions, which have exhibited inconsistent per-\nformance at a 10-year horizon. Next, we show how recent underperformance of a gender\n\nlens portfolio has been confounded by technology stocks. Finally, we explore how ESG\nscore disparities lead to important differences in portfolios constructed with these scores.\nIn aggregate, our examples point to the inherent complexity of ESG investing, which will\nbenefit from better data, transparency, customization, and an acknowledgement that doing\ngood does not necessarily lead to doing well. An important theme throughout this paper\nis that everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.\n\n1 Introduction\nTrends in investing typically follow a predictable\ncycle that begins with a new innovation, which\nfinds its way into the investment policies of early\nadopters. If the innovation gains traction in the\n\naConsortium for Data Analytics in Risk, University of Cal-\nifornia, Berkeley and One Concern.\n\nE-mail: jeffrey.r.bohn@gmail.com\nbConsortium for Data Analytics in Risk and Department of\nEconomics, University of California, Berkeley, and Aperio\nGroup (part of BlackRock).

The innova-\ntion then becomes overly promoted, which even-\ntually leads to some degree of disillusionment.\n\nAt this point, researchers, analysts, vendors, and\nportfolio managers take a step back and reflect on\n\nthe sources of concern. In some cases, the inno-\nvation disappears, while in other cases, it finds a\n\nsustainable path toward widespread adoption.\nEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG)\ninvesting is a good example of a recent investment\n14 Second Quarter 2022\n\nacademic use\n\nSustainable Investing From A Practitioner’s Viewpoint 15\n\ninnovation that appearsto be generating some dis-\nillusionment, even as it is embraced by the finan-\ncial services industry. Advocates make strong\n\nclaims regarding the financial performance of\nESG portfolios and their ability to affect social\n\nchange. Naysayers point to inconsistentESGmet-\nrics, particularly noisy data, and the entanglement\n\nof ESG factors with standard risk factors, as\nreasons to question much of the reported ESG\n\nportfolio performance. Moreover, lack of stan-\ndardized ESG metrics creates opportunities for\n\ngreenwashing by companieslessinterested in pur-\nsuing legitimate ESG objectives than in building\n\nbrand by meeting minimum criteria for a met-\nric that may be easy to game. The vast, internally\n\ninconsistent array of ESG issues makesit difficult\nor perhaps impossible to design ESG investment\nstrategies with broad appeal. Finally, there is\na growing tension between engagement, which\nrequires investment in companies whose policies\nan investor wantsto change, and divestment from\nor downweighting of those companies. These\nconsiderations make ESG investing inherently\ncomplex.\nIn this article, we take the complexity of ESG\ninvesting as a given, and focus on trade-offs\nthat arise when constructing ESG portfolios with\n\ntechniques used routinely by financial practi-\ntioners. We consider both market-cap-weighted\n\nand optimized portfolios representing different\nESG themes. As we walk the reader through our\n\nexamples, we identify factors that may affect out-\ncomes, but may not be apparent at first glance.\n\nEach extension to a given analysis improves\nour ability to identify potential anomalies that\nmight arise from ESG investing. We illustrate,\nfor example, that the return and risk profiles of\nstrategies that exclude unwanted securities from\nan index depend materially on how admissible\nsecurities are weighted. Specifically, the process\nof cap-weighting admissible securities leads to a\nsometimes substantial large-cap bias relative to\n\na benchmark. In contrast, optimizing a portfolio\nof admissible securities to reduce tracking error\nleads to a sometimes substantial correlation bias,\noverweighting securities that are correlated with\nexclusions, and potentially just as objectionable.\nWe show that unintended sector biases can drive\nthe performance of ESG portfolios. In addition,\nwe highlight portfolio-level differences that arise\nfrom relying on different ESG scores.\nOur results demonstrate that even simple rules,\nsuch as excluding a subset of securities based\non straightforward criteria, can lead to difficult\ntrade-offs, unintended factor bets, time-sample\ndependent performance that clouds evaluation,\nand outcomesthat do not align with the investor’s\noriginal motivation. Our results also show the\nchallenges associated with using ESG scores that\nmay reflect more sophisticated methodologies,\nbut still face complexities in implementation,\n\nevaluation, and interpretation. These results high-\nlight the need for transparency and best practices\n\nin ESG investing.\nPortfoliosthat includeESG considerationsmay or\nmay not generate better risk-adjusted returns than\n\npurely financial-return-focused portfolios. Natu-\nrally, a subset of ESG portfolios will outperform,\n\nand unsurprisingly, outperformance depends on\ntime, geography and countless other factors.\nOften, performance of an ESG portfolio can be\n\nexplained entirely with standard risk factor expo-\nsures. In any case, transparent and consistent ESG\n\nportfolio construction is one way to do good in the\nworld, whether or not it leads to doing well.\n\nBefore we describe our ESG portfolio con-\nstruction approaches and our efforts to explore\n\noutcomes based on these different approaches,\n\nwe highlight some of the findings in the pub-\nlished literature related to ESG portfolios. This\n\nshort non-exhaustive survey of literature provides\n\nbackground and context related to the complexi-\nties illustrated in our analysis.\n\nSecond Quarter 2022 Journal Of Investment Management\n\nacademic use\n\n16 Jeffrey R. Bohn, Lisa R. Goldberg and Simge Ulucam\n\n2 Related literature\nOver the past decade, the number of ESG-related\npublications has grown dramatically. Several\npapers highlight issues similar to the ones we\naddress in our paper. We summarize a few of\nthe more salient findings related to the results\nwe describe in our paper. An overview of ESG\n\ninvesting by the OECD discusses empirical find-\nings, practices, and motivations, and it includes\n\nan extensive list of references, especially to the\npractitioner literature; see Boffo and Patalano\n(2020).\nThe idea that some forms of ESG may be good\n\nfor a corporation date back at least to Fried-\nman (1970). A lively discussion of which ESG\n\nattributes are financially material to which com-\npanies is a backdrop against which providers of\n\nESG ratings compete for market share. While at\nleastsome investors have social or ethical reasons\nfor ESG investing, Amel-Zadeh and Serafeim\n\n(2018) report that 82% of investment profession-\nals they surveyed believe that incorporating ESG\n\ninformation into an investment evaluation process\nis financially material to investment performance.\nRespondents also indicated they typically use\n\nESGinformation to assess a firm’srisk.An emerg-\ning literature suggests that funds may use ESG\n\ninvesting to repair damage to reputation; see, for\nexample, Khanna and Warburton (2021).\nThe extent to which ESG considerations affect a\ncompany’s risk profile is widely debated. Early\n\nwork by Chia et al. (2009) identified the chal-\nlenges associated with extracting a “green\n factor\n\nrelated to renewable energy. These authors find\n\nevidence that such a factor does exist after con-\ntrolling for other risk factors. A decade later,\n\nGiese et al. (2019) argue that highly-scored ESG\ncompanies have lower cost of capital and lower\n\nidiosyncratic risk, in addition to higher profitabil-\nity and lower exposure to extreme risk. More\n\nrecently, using methods from machine learning,\n\nGoldberg and Mouti (2021) find that ESG factors\n\ndo not contribute to the predictive power of mod-\nelsthatforecast drawdown with standard financial\n\nindicators.\n\nMadhavan et al. (2021) explore how ESG com-\nponents correlate with typical risk factors (e.g.,\n\nmarket, size, value, quality, and momentum)\nTheir assessment demonstrates the importance\n\nof disentangling ESG and standard risk fac-\ntors. These authors find for a large sample of\n\nactive equity funds that “...ESG exposure was\n\nrewarded—especially for funds with high envi-\nronmentalscores associatedwith large quality and\n\nmomentum factor loadings. But the link between\nhigh ESG ratings and high returns is only through\nthe ESG components that are correlated with\n\nfactor components. Other ESG components unre-\nlated to factors carry insignificant excess return\n\npremiums that are economically small.\n (p. 85).\n\nThese results highlight the point that an ESG port-\nfolio may be masquerading as a portfolio with\n\nstandard factor exposures.\n\nOne aspect of the ESG debate related to the inter-\nplay of expected and realized returns can be quite\n\nsubtle, but still very important, as highlighted\nin the recently published work of Pastor et al.\n(2019). The argument’s narrative begins with the\nidea that a high-ESG firm should see its cost of\ncapital fall as more investors buy the firm due to\n\nits benefits (e.g., reduced long-term risk and bet-\nter quality). As cost of capital falls, the high-ESG\n\nfirm’s expected return should also fall. That is,\n“good\n firms should enjoy the benefit of having\nmore investors willing to provide capital. Thus,\nin equilibrium, high-ESG firmsshould have lower\nexpected returns.\nThe same authors point out in Pastor et al.\n(2021), however, that realized returns for a\ngreen factor for the past several years (2012 to\n2020) have been high and reflect outperformance.\nWhat explains this counter-intuitive result? It\n\nJournal Of Investment Management Second Quarter 2022\n\nacademic use\n\nSustainable Investing From A Practitioner’s Viewpoint 17\n\nlikely arises from the “surprise\n in how “green\\n\ninvestments have suddenly become more fash-\nionable. This narrative arc and accompanying\n\nresults highlight the complexity we are explor-\ning. Thus, high-ESG firms may suddenly see\n\noutperformance as a consequence of surprises\n\nthat may result from a “good\n firm that was ini-\ntially ignored or mistakenly deemed “bad\n and\n\nis suddenly deemed high-ESG, thereby attract-\ning new capital. Alternatively, the notion of ESG\n\ninvesting may become appealing enough thatsud-\ndenly new capital chases high-ESG firms. These\n\npapers illustrate how sorting out time-sample,\n\ngeographic, measurement, and market dependen-\ncies contribute to ESG-investing complexities. It\n\nis possible, of course, that trendsin investorsenti-\nment play a role in observed ESG outcomes; see,\n\nfor example, Serafeim (2020) and Mahmoud and\nMeyer (2020).\n\n3 Portfolio construction\nAs discussed in Geddes et al.(2015), Cooper et al.\n(2016), Bender et al. (2018), Henriksson et al.\n(2019), Branch et al. (2019), and many other\npublications, the method for constructing an ESG\nportfolio plays an important role in determining\nits factor exposures and risk and return profile.\nWe expand on this theme in the examples studied\nbelow.\nMany ESG strategies exclude unwanted stocks\nfrom a diversified index.1 Popular exclusions\ninclude oil stocks, tobacco and other “vice\\nstocks, and stocks with poor records on social\n\nissues such as diversity or labor practices. Moti-\nvations for avoiding securities include both eth-\nical and financial considerations. The exclusion\n\nstrategies considered in this article are based on\nthe MSCI ACWI Index, which serves as both\na universe and a benchmark. Given a set of\n\nunwanted stocksin the index, we construct a Sim-\nple Exclusion by cap-weighting the remaining\n\nstocks, and an Optimized Exclusion by weight-\ning the remaining securities to minimize forecast\n\ntracking error to the benchmark. Simple and Opti-\nmized Exclusions based on the same securities\n\ncan have very different return and risk profiles.\nWhen scores are available for securities in a\nbenchmark, we can construct ESG portfolios by\ntilting away from the benchmark. For example,\nan investor may ask for a minimum tracking\n\nerror portfolio whose carbon footprint is a frac-\ntion of the benchmark’s. Portfolios of this type\n\nare sensitive, of course, to the way the scores are\ncalculated.\n\nTracking error forecasts used to construct Opti-\nmized Exclusions and tilts are generated by the\n\nBarra Global Equity Model (GEMLTL), and\nwe use Barra’s Portfolio Manager to construct\nand rebalance optimized portfolios on a monthly\nbasis.\n\n4 Energy exclusions\n\nAn investor who objects to fossil fuel compa-\nnies on ethical or financial grounds may wish to\n\nexclude the GICS Energy sector, which includes\noil producers such as Exxon as well as oil drilling\n\nFigure 1 Rolling 10-year annualized active returns\n\nto Simple and Optimized Energy exclusion strate-\ngies benchmarked to the MSCI ACWI Index.

We look at the return and risk profiles of\n\nEnergy Exclusions over the period from August\n1995 to December 2020.\n\nRolling 10-year active returns of Simple and Opti-\nmized Energy Exclusions are shown in Figure 1.\n\nConsistent with its construction principles, the\nOptimized Exclusion hugs the benchmark more\nclosely than the Simple Exclusion.\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the rolling 10-year annu-\nalized active returns to the Energy Exclusion\n\nstrategy have mirrored the Energy sector weights.\n\nThus, the weight of the Energy sector in the index\nat any time explains, to a great extent, the active\nreturn to a Simple Energy exclusion strategy over\nthe preceding 10 years.2\nTurning to risk, Figure 3 shows the evolution\nof tracking error for the Simple and Optimized\n\nEnergy Exclusions. Both rolling three-year real-\nized tracking error (panel a) and forecast tracking\n\nerror (panel b) were uniformly higher for the\nSimple Exclusion strategy than for its Optimized\n\ncounterpart.3 The differences were greatest dur-\ning the 2008–2009 financial crisis, when tracking\n\nerror was elevated.\n\nFigure 2 Weight of the GICS Energy sector in the MSCI ACWI Index and 10-year rolling annualized active\nreturns of a Simple Energy exclusion strategy benchmarked to the MSCI ACWI Index.

August 1995–December 2020.\nSource: Aperio Group and MSCI Barra Portfolio Manager.\nA feature that distinguishes an Optimized Energy\n\nExclusion from its Simple counterpart is unin-\ntended sector bets. By design, both strategiesfully\n\nexclude the GICS Energy sector, leading to an\n\nactive weight of −7.87% in each. In the Opti-\nmized Exclusion, tracking error is reduced by\n\nplacing excess weight on sectors that are corre-\nlated with Energy, such as Materials and Utilities.\n\nThis leads to substantial average overweights for\nthese sectors as shown in Figure 4.\nIn the other direction, every Simple Exclusion\ncarries a large-cap bias. To see why, suppose that\nthe excluded securities account for a fraction γ of\nthe index weight. Then the active weight wa of\nan admissible security in a Simple Exclusion is\ngiven by\n\nwa = γ\n1 − γ\nw, (1)\nwhere w is the weight of the security in the\nindex. In other words, securities with larger\n\nmarket capitalizations have larger active weights\nin a Simple Exclusion. The same holds for\nsub-industries, industries, and sectors.\nFigure 4 shows modest average overweights for\n\nthe relatively small Materials and Utilities sec-\ntorsin the Simple Exclusion, and more substantial\n\naverage overweights in the relatively large Infor-\nmation Technology and Financials sectors. Rela-\ntive to the Simple Exclusion, active weights of\n\nlarge admissible sectors are diminished in the\nOptimized Exclusion, leading to a lower tracking\n\nerror. The performance statistics in Figure 5 indi-\ncate that the Optimized Exclusion had a higher\n\nInformation Ratio than the Simple Exclusion.\n\n5 Vice exclusions\nCurrent ESG investing practices have roots in\nthe avoidance of companies that promote or\nprofit from the exploitation of human vices,\n\nFigure 5 Performance of Simple and Optimized Energy exclusion strategies benchmarked to the MSCI ACWI\nIndex.

We omit the GICS Chemicals and Tobacco\n\nindustries as well as the GICS Brewers, Distillers\n\nand Vintners, Casinos and Gaming, Packaged\nFoods and Meats and Soft Drinks sub-industries\nfrom the MSCI ACWI Index. These industries\nand sub-industries belong to Consumer Staples,\nConsumer Discretionary, and Materials sectors.\n\nA diagram showing the structure of the Con-\nsumer Staples sector and average active weights\n\nof its industries and sub-industries over the study\nperiod is in Figure 6.\n\nFigure 7 Rolling 10-year annualized active returns\nto Simple and Optimized Vice exclusion strategies\nbenchmarked to the MSCI ACWI Index.

Some\nqualitative conclusions in the two examples are\n\nsimilar. Optimized Exclusions hug their bench-\nmarks more closely than Simple Exclusions,\n\nwhose time series of 10-year active returns mir-\nror the time series of exclusion weights. Tracking\n\nerror is regime dependent, and it is materi-\nally higher for Simple Exclusions than for their\n\nOptimized counterparts.\nAn important distinction between the Energy and\n\nVice Exclusions can be seen by comparing Fig-\nures 4 and 10. In the former case, we excluded an\n\nentire sector, which led to relatively large over-\nweights in correlated sectors for the Optimized\n\nExclusion, but not the Simple Exclusion. In the\n\nlatter case, exclusions were industries and sub-\nindustries of the Consumer Staples, Consumer\n\nDiscretionary and Materials sectors. To lower\n\ntracking error, admissible industries and sub-\nindustries such as Agricultural Products, which\n\nis part of Consumer Staples, were overweighted\nin the Optimized Exclusion, as indicated in\nFigure 11. These overweights explain why the\nmagnitude of the Consumer Staples underweight\nis greater in the Simple Exclusion than in the\nOptimized Exclusion.\nAs with the Energy Exclusions, the large-cap bias\nfor the relatively large Information Technology\nand Financials sectors is pronounced, as shown\n\nSecond Quarter 2022 Journal Of Investment Management\n\nacademic use\n\n22 Jeffrey R. Bohn, Lisa R. Goldberg and Simge Ulucam\n\nFigure 10 Average active sector weights of the Vice Exclusion strategies in Simple and Optimized exclusions\nbenchmarked to the MSCI ACWI Index.

A more nuanced aspect of the large-\ncap bias is shown in Figure 11 for Diversified\n\nBanks, the sub-industry with the largest average\n\nactive weight between August 1995 and Decem-\nber 2020. In the Optimized Exclusion, active\n\nweights of large, non-excluded sectors, industries\nand sub-industries were diminished, relative to\nthe Simple Exclusion, to minimize tracking error.\n\nConsider our exclusion of the Casino & Gam-\ning sub-industry of the Consumer Discretionary\n\nsector. The average weight of the sub-industry\nwas 0.25% between August 1995 and December\n2020. Still, the Consumer Discretionary sector\nhad a positive average active weight of 0.53%,\nas shown in Figure 10, due to the large-cap bias,\nwhich averaged 0.78%.\n\nThe performance statistics in Figure 12 indi-\ncate that the Simple Exclusion underperformed\n\nFigure 11 Average active sub-industryweights ofthe\nVice Exclusion strategies in Simple and Optimized\nexclusions benchmarked to the MSCI ACWI Index.\nAugust 1995–December 2020.\nSource: Aperio Group and MSCI Barra Portfolio Manager.\non a risk-adjusted basis, while the Optimized\nExclusion had the same return as the benchmark.\n6 Diversity and inclusion\nEmerging evidence suggests that US corporate\n\nboards are in the process of becoming more het-\nerogeneous.

The outperformance\n\nof the Information Technology sector in combina-\ntion with its underweight in the Simple Exclusion\n\nstrategy explains, to a great extent, the strategy’s\n\nunderperformance. Relative to the Simple Exclu-\nsion, active weights were muted in the Optimized\n\nExclusion, as was the underperformance.\nFrom these examples, we conclude that Gender\nExclusion strategies may be driven by unintended\n\nbets, and that these bets may be muted by opti-\nmization. The performance statistics in Figure 16\n\nsummarize the risk-adjusted underperformance\nof both the Simple and Optimized Gender\nExclusions. Any interpretation of these statistics,\n\nhowever, should take account of the short period\nover which they were collected.\n\n7 ESG scores\nWhile ESG investing has roots in the exclusion\nof unwanted securities, the growing availability\nof more nuanced ESG data facilitates portfolio\n\nconstruction techniques that go beyond exclu-\nsions. ESG scores, which can be obtained from\n\nmany different providers, are at the heart of\n\nmany sustainability-focused portfolios. Differ-\nent implementations of a single set of scores,\n\nhowever, can lead to different portfolios. We illus-\ntrate this by applying three standard construction\n\nmethodologies to scores of firms in the MSCI\n\nACWI Index. Our scores are obtained by aver-\naging MSCI’s numerical scores for the E, S and\n\nG pillars,9 and standardizing the result to have\nmean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\nOur first two strategies are Simple and Opti-\nmized Exclusions, where we omit all but the top\n\n30% of companies in our ESG ranking from the\n\nMSCIACWI Index. Our third strategy is an Opti-\nmized Tilt, which minimizes tracking error while\n\nmatching the average ESG score in the Optimized\nExclusion. The Optimized Tilt includes all the\nsecurities in the MSCI ACWI Index.10\n\nFigure 16 Performance of Simple and Optimized Gender Exclusion strategies benchmarked to the MSCI\nACWI Index.

Con-\nsistent with its construction principles, the Opti-\nmized Tilt hugged the benchmark more closely\n\nthan the other two strategies.\nThe performance statistics in Figure 18 suggest\n\nthat the Optimized ESG Tilt materially outper-\nformed the ESG Exclusions on a risk-adjusted\n\nbasis. This conclusion should be tempered, how-\never, by the short period over which the data were\n\ncollected.\nThe three ESG strategies considered above\n\nwere constructed by applying different portfo-\nlio construction methodologies to a single score.\n\nHowever, the sometimes substantial disagree-\nment across ESG scores from different providers,\n\ndocumented in Berg et al. (2020) and Dimson\n\net al. (2020a), adds another dimension of ambi-\nguity to ESG investing. We explored this by\n\nlooking at the distance between portfolios tilted\non different ESG scores. First, we constructed a\nfamily of alternative scores from the MSCI E, S,\nand G pillars by varying pillar weights between\n0% and 100% in increments of 10%. Then we\nconstructed tilted portfolios using these scores\nwhile minimizing tracking error and achieving\nan ESG score equal to 1.3 times the score of the\nbenchmark, the MSCI ACWI Index. Finally, we\nmeasured the forecast tracking error between each\ntilt and the tilt based on the equally-weighted ESG\nscore.

Without consistent\n\nmetrics, portfolio construction with ESG objec-\ntives becomes even more complex as the investor\n\nmay not achieve the objective he/she desires.\n\nThe experiments reported in this paper high-\nlight three important points that should be more\n\nprominent in discussions of ESG-based portfolio\nconstruction.\n Even if the ESG objective is clear (e.g., avoid\ncarbon-emitting firms or seek out exposure\n\nto companies that treat women well), prac-\ntical strategy implementation is complicated\n\nby inconsistent ESG analytics and challenges\narising from biases from simple exclusion\nstrategies.\n\n Even when a portfolio strategy can be consis-\ntently implemented, risk-adjusted returns do\n\nnot necessarily outperform more conventional\n\nstrategies. Empirical evidence fails to support\noutperformance of ESG strategies.11\n ESG portfolios may, in fact, reflect exposure\nprimarily to other risk factors. That is, after\ncontrolling for standard risk factors, ESG risk\nmay not be significant. This result does not\n\nmean ESG objectives should not be incorpo-\nrated into portfolio construction, but rather\n\ninvestors should be clear about what risks they\nare taking.\nThese findings highlight the need fortransparency\nand best practices in ESG investing.\nBefore the widespread development of ESG\nmetrics, exclusion-based strategies reflected an\napproach to implement constraints that may\nnot directly relate to maximizing risk-adjusted\nreturns. Branch et al. (2019) describe a more\n\nsophisticated approach to incorporate ESG objec-\ntives into portfolio construction in their A Guide\n\nto ESG Portfolio Construction\n. Our paper illus-\ntrates aspects of how transparent risk disen-\ntanglement can improve understanding of the\n\nactual risks in an ESG portfolio. Robust port-\nfolio management requires understanding actual\n\nrisk exposures, regardless of high-level portfolio\nobjectives.\nAs demonstrated with the different strategies\ndescribed in these analyses, one objective e.g,\nexclude a cohort of energy or vice companies\nper a particular sector mapping) potentially leads\nto unintended bets such as going overweight\nin materials. While optimized strategies with a\n\ngiven ESG objective such as excluding an unde-\nsirable asset sub-portfolio may mitigate some\n\nof the knife-edge behavior arising in exclusion\nstrategies, unintended bets may still appear as a\n\nparticularstrategy with a given investment oppor-\ntunity set will eventually hit tracking-error lower\n\nbounds. Thus, another dimension of ESG-related\ninvesting complexity arises from the difficulty in\n\nJournal Of Investment Management Second Quarter 2022\n\nacademic use\n\nSustainable Investing From A Practitioner’s Viewpoint 27\n\naddressing all (or even a large subset of ESG\n\nconcerns) simultaneously. Moreover, the result-\ning strategy may ostensibly focus on one theme,\n\ne.g., avoid vice stocks, only to become a different\nmix of seriously active bets.\n\nIn these contexts, optimization approaches consti-\ntute one way to minimize some of the challenges\n\nour results illustrate. Moreover, these examples\n\ndemonstrate transparency in a way that can con-\ntribute to bettersorting out when results arise from\n\ntime-specific and/or sector-specific characteris-\nticssuch asBigTech (i.e., (F)acebook, (A)mazon,\n\n(A)pple, (M)icrosoft, (G)oogle– FAAMGs) driv-\ning returns. Once a key driver shifts (e.g, changes\n\nin thresholds, ESG metric construction, invest-\nment opportunity set, and geography) related to\n\na particular portfolio’s construction and perfor-\nmance evaluation, the outcomes can be highly\n\nvariable. Our analysis shows how one can add\n\nmore transparency to better understand the impli-\ncations of ESG objectives, which could include\n\nunintended risk profiles and risk-adjusted under-\nperformance.\n\nUsing ESG ratings (in this case from MSCI)\nis not as straightforward as many have initially\nassumed. As others have pointed out (see Berg\net al. (2020)), ESG ratings are not consistent\n\nacross vendors. We did not address this dimen-\nsion of ESG-related complexity in this paper.\n\nRather, we focused on the fact that using one\n\nanalytical approach can still generate quite dif-\nferent portfolio outcomes depending on how a\n\nstrategy is implemented. Thus, a simple appli-\ncation of ESG ratings to build ESG portfolios is\n\nmore complicated than it appears.\nAn important theme that threads through this\nanalysis reflects the regular misalignment of\nobjectives and actual risk exposure. That is, a\nparticular ESG portfolio often reflects unintended\nrisk bets and may not even align with the original\n\nESG objective. Disentangling the risk expo-\nsures and understanding the underlying drivers\n\nof ESG portfolio outcomes contributes to more\neffective approaches to addressing ESG portfolio\nconstruction complexity.\n\n9 Conclusion\n\nAchieving ESG objectives in portfolio construc-\ntion is a noble goal. These results illustrate why\n\nachieving this goal is not as easy as early adopters\nassumed. As more data become available and\nESG analytics become more standardized and\nmore clearly defined, we will have an easier\n\ntime addressing the complexity of ESG invest-\ning. In the meantime, transparency in profiling\n\nthe risk of a given ESG portfolio is essential to\n\nunderstanding which portfolios are actually out-\nperforming on a risk-adjusted basis. Many ESG\n\ninvestors will find that they are taking unintended\n\nrisks and will often underperform. These out-\ncomes should not deter proper ESG investing;\n\nbut rather, focus the discussions on why par-\nticular objectives are targeted. Doing well (in\n\nterms of risk-adjusted performance) by doing\ngood (in terms of targeting consistently defined\nESG objectives) will happen sometimes, but not\nall the time. Setting aside financial performance,\nwe conclude that we should do good whether\nor not we do well, and have transparency to\nensure that we understand an ESG portfolio’srisk,",
The Wollemi pine was thought to have gone extinct 2 million years ago until it was rediscovered by a group of hikers in 1994. Now, scientists have decoded its genome to understand how its survived — almost unchanged — since the time of the dinosaurs.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n Comments (0)\nclose up of a wollemi pine tree, a species that has survived since the cretaceous period\n\nThe Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis) was rediscovered by a group of hikers in 1994.  (Image credit: Dave Watts/Getty Images)\nIn 1994, hikers discovered a group of strange trees growing in a canyon in Wollemi National Park, about 60 miles (100 kilometers) west of Sydney, Australia. One hiker notified a park service naturalist, who then showed leaf specimens to a botanist. It was ultimately determined they represented an ancient species that had been essentially frozen in time since dinosaurs roamed Earth. \n\nCalled a living fossil by some, the Wollemi pine (Wollemia nobilis) is nearly identical to preserved remains dating to the Cretaceous period (145 million to 66 million years ago). There are now just 60 of these trees in the wild — and these tenacious survivors are threatened by bushfires in the region. It was thought to have gone extinct around 2 million years ago. \n\nNow, scientists from Australia, the United States and Italy have decoded its genome, shedding light on its unique evolution and reproductive habits, as well as aiding conservation efforts. The paper was posted to the preprint database bioRxiv on Aug. 24 and has not been peer reviewed. \n\nSponsored Links\nCan this game really train your brain?\nGame of Thrones\nRelated: World's deepest canyon is home to Asia's tallest tree - and Chinese scientists only just found it\n\nThe pine has 26 chromosomes — containing a staggering 12.2 billion base pairs. In comparison, humans have only around 3 billion base pairs. Despite the size of their genome, Wollemi pines are extremely low in genetic diversity, suggesting a bottleneck (when the population is reduced dramatically) some 10,000 to 26,000 years ago. \n\nA Wollemi pine - a tree thought extinct until 1994 when hikers came across\n\nThere are now just 60 Wollemi pines in the wild and these are threatened by bushfires. (Image credit: Dave Watts/Getty Images)\nIndeed, the plants do not exchange much genetic material. The remaining trees appear to reproduce mostly by cloning themselves through coppicing — in which suckers emerge from the base and become new trees.\n\nTheir rarity may be partly due to the high number of transposons, or jumping genes — stretches of DNA that can change their position within the genome. These elements also account for the genome's size. The tiniest plant genome and the largest plant genome have almost the same number of genes. Large differences in size usually come from transposons, Gerald Schoenknecht, program director for the National Science Foundation’s Plant Genome Research Program told Live Science. Schoenknecht was not involved with the research, but the NSF did provide funding.\n\nAs transposons leap to new locations, they can change the sequence of letters in a DNA molecule, thus causing or reversing mutations in genes. They may carry functional DNA with them or alter DNA at the site of insertion, and thus have a substantial impact on the evolution of an organism. \n\nIf the transposons induced harmful mutations, they may have contributed to population decline precipitated by a changing climate and other factors, the researchers said. These stressful conditions may have led the plant to switch to clonal reproduction. Because increases in transposons correlate to sexual reproduction, a change to asexual reproduction may have reduced their potential introduction of damaging mutations. Paradoxically, while the trees were still reliant on sexual reproduction, the transposons may have played a role in increasing genetic diversity and thus at least temporarily made them more resilient to  changing conditions. \n\nrock with the fossil of a wollemi pine being held by 2 hands on a black background\n\nA replica fossil of a 90 million year old specimen of a Woolemi pine.  (Image credit: Chris McGrath/Getty Images)\nIn 99% of all cases, mutations are probably not a good idea,Schoenknecht said. But over millions of years, the 1% that helps can move the species forward. In this case it may have been a bit of an advantage.\n\nDecoding the genome has also revealed why the Wollemi pine appears to be susceptible to disease — in particular, Phytophthora cinnamomi, a pathogenic water mold that causes dieback. The tres disease resistant genes are suppressed by a type of its own RNA that is associated with the development of wider leaves. Wollemi pines, unlike most conifers, have wide needles. \n\nSo, the evolution of wider leaves may have led to the suppression of disease resistance and opened the species up to pathogenic threats — which may have been inadvertently tracked in by hikers who illegally visited the protected spot. P. cinnamomi is common in cultivated plants.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n—Do trees exist (scientifically speaking)?\n\n—Listen to the sounds of Pando, the largest living tree in the world\n\n—The oldest tree in the world (and the 7 runner-ups)\n\nWhile only four small populations remain in the wild, the pines have been extensively propagated by botanic gardens and other institutions in an effort to conserve them and study their unique biology. The species is considered critically endangered by the IUCN. \n\nThus, the analysis of the Wollemi pines genome is not simply an academic curiosity — it has serious implications for the species survival. \n\n'",
Ecologists found that species’ environmental DNA (eDNA) can offer insights into genetics of whole populations, aiding in tracking and preventing invasive species’ spread. This eDNA advancement also assists in the conservation of endangered species, offering insights akin to forensic investigations.\n\nEcologists have shown that the genetic material that species shed into their environments can reveal not only the presence of the species but also a broad range of information about the genetics of whole populations. This information can assist researchers in pinpointing the origin of a newly invasive population and in halting further invasions.\n\nThe advancement in environmental DNA eDNA also opens new possibilities for protecting endangered and vulnerable species.\n\n\nFor the benefit of biodiversity conservation, were getting closer and closer to what forensic scientists do every day at crime scenes, said study co-author David Lodge, director of the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability.\n\nIn the new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers demonstrated that their methodology was successful in field sampling of invasive round goby fish throughout the Great Lakes and the New York Finger Lakes.\n\nIn their Great Lakes study, which involved collecting water and tissue samples from round goby fish in 13 locations from Lake Michigan to Oneida Lake, the researchers found that their eDNA sampling methodology can be used to detect nuclear genetic variations, making it possible to analyze genetic diversity and variation within species. This information is useful for natural resource managers because it can help them trace the source of a new invasive population as well as prevent further invasion or minimize harm by determining how invasive species are moving and how to stop them.\n\n\nThe breakthrough can also help scientists understand the demographics of imperiled species without requiring the physical capture of animals that are already rare and vulnerable. Species experiencing population declines can suffer from a loss of genetic diversity, and eDNA may allow researchers to detect those declines earlier, according to the first author of the study, Kara Andres.\n\nAndres is a former graduate student in Lodge’s lab and now a postdoctoral fellow at Washington University in St. Louis. She wrote the paper with co-authors Lodge and Jose Andres, a Cornell Atkinson faculty fellow and a senior research associate who co-directs the Cornell Environmental DNA and Genomics Core Facility.\n\nIt is a major step in unlocking the full potential of genomics techniques when applied to aquatic eDNA samples, Jose Andres said. In the near future, I anticipate that this technique will allow us to study the status and health of elusive species. I believe this holds profound implications, particularly in marine environments.

More than half of US greenhouse gas emissions come from transportation and electricity generation, and, thankfully, the falling cost of clean alternatives, such as EVs and solar power, offers a clear path to decarbonizing both sectors.However, another 23% of US emissions comes from industry — and slashing those emissions is going to be a bigger challenge.Steel, cement, and chemicals are the top three emitting industries and are among the most difficult to decarbonize, owing to technical factors like the need for very high heat and process emissions of carbon dioxide, and economic factors including low profit margins, capital intensity, long asset life, and trade exposure, researchers at the Brookings Institute wrote in 2021. Until we can figure out how to replace fossil fuels in industry, the next best thing may be to stop their emissions from reaching the atmosphere.Carbon capture 101: The idea behind carbon capture is to extract CO2 from a highly concentrated source, such as flue gas, before it is released into the atmosphere. The carbon can then be stored underground or used to make products, such as jet fuel. (This is different from direct air carbon capture, which pulls CO2 from the atmosphere, where it is highly diffused.)The significant energy needed for regeneration is holding back the adoption of carbon capture technology.These systems can capture 90% or more of the carbon in flue gas, and they typically work by funneling the exhaust into a special chamber filled with a solution that contains ammonia-based compounds, called amines. The CO2 in the flue gas binds to the amines in this solution, while the rest of the exhaust is vented into the atmosphere.
The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. 1. IntroductionCommerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party. What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party. Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers. Inthis paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes. 12. Transactions We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to th next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership. The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spendthe coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on thecompany running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank. We need a way for the payee to know that the previous owners did not sign any earlier transactions. For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions. In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and decided which arrived first. To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be  publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the order in which they were received. The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received. 3. Timestamp ServerThe solution we propose begins with a timestamp server. A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post [2-5]. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, obviously, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it. 2 Block Item Item ...HashBlockItem Item ...HashTransactionOwner 1'sPublic KeyOwner 0'sSignatureHashTransactionOwner 2'sPublic KeyOwner 1'sSignatureHashVerifyTransactionOwner 3'sPublic KeyOwner 2'sSignatureHashVerifyOwner 2'sPrivate KeyOwner 1'sPrivate Key SignSignOwner 3'sPrivate Key4. Proof-of-WorkTo implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need t use a proofof-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts.The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, thehash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the numberof zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in theblock until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits. Once the CPUeffort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changedwithout redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the blockwould include redoing all the blocks after it.The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decisionmaking. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyonable to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majoritydecision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort investedin it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow thefastest and outpace any competing chains. To modify a past block, an attacker would have toredo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass thework of the honest nodes. We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching updiminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time,the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number ofblocks per hour. If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.5. NetworkThe steps to run the network are as follows:1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in thechain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working onextending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, somenodes may receive one or the other first. In that case, they work on the first one they received,but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next proofof-work is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the otherbranch will then switch to the longer one.3BlockPrev Hash NonceTx Tx ...BlockPrev Hash NonceTx Tx ...New transaction broadcasts do not necessarily need to reach all nodes. As long as they reachmany nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of droppedmessages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block andrealizes it missed one.6. Incentivey convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin ownedby the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and providesa way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expendingresources to add gold to circulation. In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction isless than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value ofthe block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have enteredcirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflationfree.The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able toassemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using itto defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought tofind it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins thaneveryone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.7. Reclaiming Disk SpaceOnce the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions beforeit can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes donot need to be stored.A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks aregenerated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systemstypically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept inmemory.4Block BlockBlock Header (Block Hash)rev Hash Nonc Hash1 Hash2 Hash3Hash23Root HashHash01Hash2Tx3Hash23Block Header (Block Hash)Root HashHashed in a Merkle Tree After Pruning Tx0-2 from the BlockPrev Hash NonceHash3Tx0 Tx1 Tx2 Tx3. Simplified Payment VerificationIt is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keepa copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by queryingnetwork nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branchlinking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction forhimself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it,and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is morevulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verifytransactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalidblock, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions toconfirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want torun their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.
Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow onlinepayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the mainbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
